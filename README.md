# YouTube Controls Extension

## Why I Created This Extension

I created this browser extension to allow myself to control YouTube videos while relaxing in bed with my Bluetooth mouse. The extension displays large, easy-to-click control buttons when hovering over any YouTube video, making it simple to:

- Play/pause the video
- Skip backward 10 seconds
- Skip forward 10 seconds

Youtube only provides next button, no skip backward or forward buttons. We have to use keyboard to skip backward or forward. This extension provides a solution to that problem.

The extension provides a convenient way to control video playback without needing to get up or move closer to the screen.
